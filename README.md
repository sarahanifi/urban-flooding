#1. Multi-Scale Target-Specified Sub-Model Approach for Fast
Large-Scale High-Resolution 2D Urban Flood Modelling

Urban floods are an increasing threat due to ongoing urbanization and climate change.

Effective flood forecasting systems are crucial for early warnings and require accurate, timely spatial and temporal flood predictions.
 
This research reviews two primary types of flood models: 2D hydrodynamic models and 1D static models.

The study aims to develop a complementary 1D/2D solution that maximizes the strengths of both model types while minimizing their limitations.
